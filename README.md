This Python code establishes a function that invokes the Crossref API for the recent five papers with the keyword "neuroimaging," parses the gotten JSON to retrieve every paper title, authors list, publication date, and DOI link, and prints this information in clean, numbered form. It also handles network errors by catching exception on the API call, checks for records returned, and prints "No papers found" nicely if the query has no matches. You can run it with a python3 llm_neuroimaging.py and it'll output a one-line summary of all the major metadata for each paper to the console.
